# TODOs

1. Run a Groovy LSP exposed via Spring Boot backend (JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol I think), see https://langserver.org/ for a list, probably use https://github.com/GroovyLanguageServer/groovy-language-server
1. Hook up Groovy LSP to Monaco (see https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient)


# Pending PoC's

* Sandbox Groovy (see how Jenkins does this, use Groovy Compiler AST whitelisting, etc.)
* Provide contextual info (functions, objects) to the Groovy LSP for the Monaco editor to provide decent Groovy script editing
* 

# Possible Alternatives

1. Maybe try CodeMirror + LSPs too?
